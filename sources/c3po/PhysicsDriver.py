class PhysicsDriver(DataAccessor):
    """! PhysicsDriver is an abstract class which standardizes the functionalities expected by computer codes.

    It follows the ICoCo (Interface for Code Coupling) V2 standard.
    The ICoCo V2 I/O (in/out) methods are defined in the mother class DataAccessor.

    ICoCo V2 is originally defined for C++ here: https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/icoco-coupling.
    PhysicsDriver (together with DataAccessor) can be seen as the translation in Python of ICoCo V2.

    In order to use a code with C3PO it is necessary to define a class that inherits from PhysicsDriver and to overload
    needed methods (including the ones of DataAccessor).
    Note that not all the methods need to be implemented! Mandatory methods are marked as such.

    Some of the methods may not be called when some conditions are not met (i.e. when not in the correct context). Thus
    in this documentation we define the "TIME_STEP_DEFINED context" as the context that the code finds itself, when the method
    initTimeStep() has been called, and the method validateTimeStep() (or abortTimeStep()) has not yet been called.
    This is the status in which the current computation time step is well defined.

    Within the computation of a time step (so within TIME_STEP_DEFINED), the temporal semantic of the fields (and
    scalar values) is not imposed by the norm. Said differently, it does not require the fields to be defined at the
    start/middle/end of the current time step, this semantic must be agreed on between the codes being coupled.
    Fields and scalar values that are set within the TIME_STEP_DEFINED context are invalidated (undefined behavior)
    after a call to validateTimeStep() (or abortTimeStep()). They need to be set at each time step. However, fields and scalar
    values that are set outside of this context (before the first time step for example, or after the resolution of the last
    time step) are permanent (unless modified afterward within the TIME_STEP_DEFINED context).
